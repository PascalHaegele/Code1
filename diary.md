### Git:
+ A **repository** is a database which tracks changes made to files.
+ A **remote** repository is hosted on the internet(like Github) or on another network for multiple collaborators to access it.

---

+ Git **commit** creates a snapshot of the changes made files in the repository.
+ Git **stage** marks changes to be used for the next commit.

---

+ Git **fetch** downloads all changes from a remote without apllying them to the local repository.
+ Git **pull** fetches from a remote and also updates the local repository.
+ Git **push** uploads changes from the local repository to the romote without apllying them(opposite of fetch).

---

+ A **branch** takes a commit as a base and creates a seperate line of commits that don't affect other branches.
+ Git **merge** combines commits of two diffrent cranches into one.

---

+ A **.gitignore** file can be used to prevent files from being tracked.
+ Git **clean** removes all untracked files from the repository.

---

+ Git **stash** saves changes for later and reverts them.
+ Git **reset** goes back to a specific commit and discards all changes after it.
